I HATE EXAM!!  
BUT I NEED CREDIT!!

# Express project with Vue.js
This is one of the products of escaping reality during the exam period. I'd like to say a big thank you to [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) for helping me with my English composition, which I can't speak English.  
The immediate goal of this branch is having Express server deliver views based on a .vue file instead of a .pug file. It will be updated irregularly.  
In addition, I may come up with new extensions. It's all unpredictable.  
If you've been tempted to touch Vue.js, or to try a more advanced web applications, this branch could be an option for you.
